## Introduction

Adopting a consistent ticket creation convention is crucial for the effective management and tracking of tasks, features, and bugs in our projects. This facilitates better understanding and handling of the project scope and issues among the team members.

## Ticket Types

When creating a ticket in JIRA, it is essential to specify the ticket type clearly to streamline our workflow and ensure proper categorization of tasks, features, and bugs.

### Types

- **BUG (`BUG`)**: Use this type when there's a regression or an issue stemming from a previously completed FEATURE or TASK.
- **FEATURE (`FEATURE`)**: This type is used for new functionalities, such as the creation of a new page or feature within the project.
- **TASK (`TASK`)**: Regular or maintenance tasks such as site updates or client-requested text changes fall under this category.

## Examples

Here are some examples to clarify the usage of each ticket type:

- **Bug in login feature**: `BUG: Error in user authentication post password reset` - A ticket created when a bug is identified in a recently updated login feature.
- **New user dashboard page**: `FEATURE: Create new dashboard page for user settings` - A ticket for the development of a new feature, specifically a new page in the application.
- **Update website content**: `TASK: Update homepage text as per client's new requirements` - A regular task for updating the content of the homepage based on client feedback.

## Conclusion

Following this convention is imperative for all team members involved in the project. It ensures that everyone is on the same page regarding how tasks are categorized and managed within JIRA. Should there be any confusion or a need for an exception to these rules, team members should consult with the project manager.
